# wpg_tutorial
This is tutorial for [WPG](https://github.com/samoylv/WPG), an interactive simulation framework for X-ray wavefront propagation. 

WPG provides intuitive interface to the [SRW library](https://github.com/ochubar/SRW). 

The [application examples](http://wpg.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorials.html) are  mainly oriented on [European XFEL](http://www.xfel.eu) design parameters. 

See WPG installation details for [Linux](http://wpg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wpg.html#on-ubuntu-desktop), [Mac OS X](http://wpg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wpg.html#mac-os-x) and [MS Windows](http://wpg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wpg.html#on-ms-windows).

For visualization and browsing HDF5 files you can download [HDFVeiw tool](http://www.hdfgroup.org/hdf-java-html/hdfview/).
