# wpg_tutorial
This is tutorial for [WPG](https://github.com/samoylv/WPG), an interactive simulation framework for X-ray wavefront propagation, which provides intuitive interface to the [SRW library](https://github.com/ochubar/SRW). You can observe tutorial notebooks with output [here](https://github.com/samoylv/wpg_tutorial/tree/master/reports).  

The [application examples](http://wpg.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorials.html) are  mainly oriented on [European XFEL](http://www.xfel.eu) design parameters. 

See WPG [documentation](http://wpg.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) and installation details for [Linux](http://wpg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wpg.html#on-ubuntu-desktop), [Mac OS X](http://wpg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wpg.html#mac-os-x) and [MS Windows](http://wpg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wpg.html#on-ms-windows).

For running the examples you would need [XPD FEL pulses data](https://in.xfel.eu/xpd/). With MS Windows installation it could be a problem with downloading data from the script. In this case you have to download zip-file, unzip it into *data_wpg_tutorial_01* subfolder and change the name of the pulse file in the script. 

For visualization and browsing HDF5 files you can download [HDFVeiw tool](https://support.hdfgroup.org/products/java/hdfview/).
