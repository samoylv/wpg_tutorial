# wpg_tutorial
This is tutorial for [WPG](https://github.com/samoylv/WPG), an interactive simulation framework for X-ray wavefront propagation, which provides intuitive interface to the [SRW library](https://github.com/ochubar/SRW). You can observe tutorial notebooks with output [here](https://github.com/samoylv/wpg_tutorial/tree/master/reports).  

The [application examples](http://wpg.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorials.html) are  mainly oriented on [European XFEL](http://www.xfel.eu) design parameters. 

See WPG [documentation](http://wpg.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) and installation details for [Linux](http://wpg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wpg.html#on-ubuntu-desktop), [Mac OS X](http://wpg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wpg.html#mac-os-x) and [MS Windows](http://wpg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wpg.html#on-ms-windows).

For running the examples you would need [XPD FEL pulses data](https://in.xfel.eu/xpd/). With MS Windows installation it could be a problem with downloading data from the script. In this case you have to download [zip-file](https://in.xfel.eu/xpd/output/2016/10/57f354b36aa81/s1_8_43_100_xy75_ss14_nzc15_hdf5.zip) and unzip it into *data_wpg_tutorial_01* subfolder. 

You can find some completed XPD requests for simulated [hard](https://in.xfel.eu/xpd/57f354b36aa81) and [soft](https://in.xfel.eu/xpd/57f3e79e925bb) SASE X-ray FEL pulses and for [FLASH source](https://in.xfel.eu/xpd/57f5182e2d9cc) 

For visualization and browsing HDF5 files you can download [HDFVeiw tool](https://support.hdfgroup.org/products/java/hdfview/).
